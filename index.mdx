## Core React Concepts

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="1. Understanding Props in React">
  In React, `props` (short for **properties**) are used to **pass data from a parent component to a child component**.

  React automatically provides a `props` object to every functional component. This object contains all the values passed as attributes when the component is used.

  ### ðŸ‘‡ Example:
  The parent component (`App`) passes a prop to the child (`User`) like this:

  ```jsx
  const App = () => {
    return <User name="skyWalker" />; /* you have to wrap everything except strings 
    (numbers, bools, arrays) in curly braces while passing as props eg age={18} */
  };

  const User = (props) => {
    console.log(props); // { name: "skyWalker" }
    return <section></section>;
  };
```

  </Accordion>
